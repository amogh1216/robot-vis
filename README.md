# robot-vis

This is a full-stack application in extension of the [https://github.com/amogh1216/motion-planning](PyQt UI tool) I made for a simulating differential drive robot in Gazebo using ROS. This is a simplified simulation engine in Go with state updates displayed in React.

See Docker Compose to deploy locally.
